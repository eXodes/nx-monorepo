## Adding capabilities to your workspace

Nx supports many plugins which add capabilities for developing different types of applications and different tools.

These capabilities include generating applications, libraries, etc as well as the devtools to test, and build projects as well.

Below are plugins used:

- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev)

  - `npm install --save-dev @nxext/sveltekit`

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev)

  - `npm install --save-dev @nxext/svelte`

- [Nest](https://nestjs.com)

  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/nest`

- [Docker](https://github.com/nx-tools/nx-tools/tree/main/packages/nx-docker)

  - `npm install --save-dev @nx-tools/nx-docker`

- [SemVer](https://github.com/jscutlery/semver)

  - `npm install --save-dev @jscutlery/semver`

There are also many [community plugins](https://nx.dev/community) you could add.

## Generate an application

When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same workspace.

### SvelteKit

Run `nx g @nxext/sveltekit:application $app-name` to generate a SvelteKit application.

### Nest

Run `nx g @nrwl/nest:app $app-name` to generate a Nest application.

## Generate a library

Libraries are shareable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from `@nx-monorepo/$lib-name`.

> Due to issue [sveltejs/kit#2973](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/2973), you will need to add a `package.json` file to the root of your library that SvelteKit want to import. You may duplicate the content of the `package.json` file of other library and change the name.

### Svelte Component

Run `nx g @nxext/svelte:library $lib-name` to generate a Svelte component library.

### Nest Library

Run `nx g @nrwl/nest:library $lib-name` to generate a Nest library.

**Resource**

Run `nx g @nrwl/nest:resource $resource-name` to generate a Nest resource.

Resource consist of module, controller, service, dto and entities for basic CRUD process.

**Module**

Run `nx g @nrwl/nest:module $module-name` to generate a Nest module.

**Controller**

Run `nx g @nrwl/nest:controller $controller-name` to generate a Nest controller.

**Service**

Run `nx g @nrwl/nest:service $service-name` to generate a Nest service.

**Resolver**

Run `nx g @nrwl/nest:resolver $resolver-name` to generate a Nest resolver.

**Gateway**

Run `nx g @nrwl/nest:gateway $gateway-name` to generate a Nest gateway.

**Middleware**

Run `nx g @nrwl/nest:middleware $middleware-name` to generate a Nest middleware.

**Interceptor**

Run `nx g @nrwl/nest:interceptor $interceptor-name` to generate a Nest interceptor.

**Filter**

Run `nx g @nrwl/nest:filter $filter-name` to generate a Nest filter.

**Guard**

Run `nx g @nrwl/nest:guard $guard-name` to generate a Nest guard.

**Pipe**

Run `nx g @nrwl/nest:pipe $pipe-name` to generate a Nest pipe.

**Decorator**

Run `nx g @nrwl/nest:decorator $decorator-name` to generate a Nest decorator.

**Class**

Run `nx g @nrwl/nest:class $class-name` to generate a Nest class.

> Alternatively, you can use `--project=$lib-name` to skip the prompt for the library name.

### Typescript Function

Run `nx g lib $lib-name` to generate a functional library.

## Code scaffolding

Run `nx g @nxext/svelte:component $component-name --project=$lib-name` to generate a new component.

## Development server

Run `npm run serve` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the tests for all the projects.

Run `nx affected:test` to execute the tests affected by a change.

## Understand your workspace

Run `nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.
